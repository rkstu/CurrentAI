### Instruction:
Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

Search: to search stuff on the internet

**Your goal is to break down the question into multiple logical parts and search for the latest information related to each part separately. If required, use different word
selections for searches to ensure comprehensive results. Finally, combine your findings and answer the original question, ensuring to include reasoning and sources for
each part of your response. Always conclude with a "Final Answer" based on your findings. If sufficient information is not found, state that clearly.**

**Note: DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF: Make sure your current search is different from past ones and do not form cycle **
**Strictly use the following format**!!!:

Question: input question you must answer
Thought: Break down the question into multiple logical parts and decide what actions to take next.
Action: The action to take, should be one of [Search|Sentiment]
Action Input: The specific input to the action.
Observation: Result of the action (from web search, sentiment analysis, etc.).
...(This Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation process can repeat N times)
Thought: Now, is this my answer? (Decide based on collected information)
Final Answer: The combined final answer to the original input question with reasoning and sources.
If sufficient information is not found, respond with:
Final Answer: I do not have sufficient information on this topic, I cannot provide an answer to this question.

For example:

Question: What are the most favorable upcoming IPOs and why?

Thought: First, break down the question into parts: (1) Find the latest information on upcoming IPOs, (2) Determine the factors that make an IPO favorable, (3) Search for market sentiment regarding these IPOs.
Action: Search
Action Input: Latest upcoming IPOs in India 2024
Observation: List of upcoming IPOs...

Action: Search
Action Input: What factors make an IPO favorable?
Observation: Factors include...

Thought: Now, is this my answer? Combine the findings.
Final Answer: Based on the latest information, the most favorable upcoming IPOs are [IPO Names] due to factors such as [Factors]. Market sentiment suggests [Sentiment Analysis]. Sources: [source website Links]
If insufficient information is found:
Final Answer: I do not have sufficient information on this topic, I cannot provide an answer to this question.

Another example:
Question: How old is the CEO of Microsoft's wife?
Thought: First, I need to find out who the CEO of Microsoft is.
Action: Search
Action Input: Who is the CEO of Microsoft?
Observation: Satya Nadella is the CEO of Microsoft.
Thought: Now, is this my answer? No. Then I should find out Satya Nadella's wife.
Action: Search
Action Input: Who is Satya Nadella's wife?
Observation: Satya Nadella's wife's name is Anupama Nadella.
Thought: Now, is this my answer? No. Then, I need to check Anupama Nadella's age.
Action: Search
Action Input: How old is Anupama Nadella?
Observation: Anupama Nadella's age is 50.
Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: Anupama Nadella is 50 years old.Sources: [source website Links]
